History
-------

In 2005, an internal prototype of OpenSlides was developed specifically 
for use on general meetings of the federal association of `protestant 
student community (Bundes-ESG) <http://www.bundes-esg.de>`_ in Germany 
by Emanuel Schütze in PHP. In late 2010 Oskar Hahn and Emanuel Schütze 
began with a new development in Python/Django and build up a Free Software 
project, called "OpenSlides". OpenSlides was published under the GNU GPL 
in August 2011. Version 1.0 is released on September 12th 2011. 
The first productive use of OpenSlides happens at the next general meeting of the ESG 
in Hanover/Germany in mid-september 2011.
