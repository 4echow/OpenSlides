What is OpenSlides?
===================

OpenSlidea is a free, web-based presentation system for displaying and controlling of agendas, applications, polls and elections of an event.

With OpenSlides all contents of an event (such as agenda, application text, list of speakers, lists of candidates, election results) can be projected on the screen up to date. The moderation of the annual meeting controls and edits interactive the content. Also OpenSlides manages the present participants, so it is easy to put up candidates for upcoming elections, generate pre-printed ballots and display election and poll results.

The novel feature is the function to involve the plenary assembly: Each participant of an event has the opportunity to log in to OpenSlides with their laptop or smartphone via WLAN. Here, the participants can e.g. submit an application, support applications from other participants, candidate in upcoming elections, suggest candidates or check voting results.

OpenSlides is designed for use at events such as assemblies of delegates, general meetings and party congresses. There is no limit to participants.

The significant advantage of OpenSlides over conventional office presentation tools, such as MS PowerPoint or OpenOffice Impress, is to edit slides on an editing system. The projector does not need to leave the presentation mode and can always display the current slide.
