name: Prevent manual changes of initial-data.json without md5 hash
# The file initial-data.json has a migration-index (MI) set to an active migration,
# In consequence setting up a new system triggers migrations beginning at this MI.
# That's the reason this file is protected against unwanted/unintended edits.
#
# If one is sure to change the initial-data.json file it is allowed!
# 1. Change the file
# 2. Get the md5sum for changed initial-dta.json
# 3. Change the md5-check-literal in this workflow-file
